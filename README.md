Inludes singular subreddits that have been parsed, also has shortned versions of them.  

[C++ Parser](https://github.com/Medscootsman/RedditStudy/blob/master/scripts/parser/subreddit_parser.cpp)  
short = removed pointless columns, removed score < 0, removed deleted comments, removed top bots (there could still be more bots)
